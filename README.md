# Push_Swap
Second Algo Project @42 Paris.

**Project score : [111 / 100]**

Push-Swap is an algorithmic sorting project which consists of sorting an unordered list of numbers using only two stacks, A and B, while only using the following limited actions:

 - sa : swap a - inverts the two first elements at the top of stack A.
 - sb : swap b - interts the two first elements at the top of stack B.
 - ss : sa & sb at the same time.
 - pa : push a - puts the first element of stack B on top of stack A.
 - pb : push a - puts the first element of stack A on top of stack B.
 - ra : rotate a - move up all elements of stack A. The first element becomes the last.
 - rb : rotate a - move up all elements of stack B. The first element becomes the last.
 - rr : ra & rb at the same time.
 - rra : reverse rotate a - move down all elements of stack A. The last element becomes the first.
 - rrb : reverse rotate a - move down all elements of stack B. The last element becomes the first.
 - rrr : rra & rrb at the same time.
